# Node.js Server Port Already in Use Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when developing Node.js applications: the failure to start a server when the specified port is already in use.  The example showcases the issue and proposes improved error handling techniques.

## Problem

Attempting to start a Node.js server on a port that's already occupied by another process will cause the server to fail. The default error message can be unclear and unhelpful for developers.

## Solution

Robust error handling is crucial.  The solution provided incorporates a `try...catch` block to gracefully handle the `EADDRINUSE` error, providing a more informative message to the user and suggesting alternative actions.
